# Chp1 Prices,Discount factors and arbitrage
We will use U.S> Treasury coupon bond and STRIPS markets as example

## 1. Fixed-rate Government coupon bonds
Key elements:
1. face amount, principal amount or par value
2. coupon rate
3. maturity date
2 1/8 s coupon rate means annual coupon rate is 2.125%
Almost all U.S. Treasury trades settle T+1
full price = flat or quoted price + accrued interest

## 2. Discount factors
Discount factor gives us the present value of the future cash. We can obtain them from the U.S. Treasury Note and bond prices. We can solve the linear equations.
We can use the discount factors to price the Treasury and find arbitrage opportunity. Bur since arbitrageurs would rush en masse to do any such trade, market prices would quickly adjust to rule out any such opportunity.

# Chp2 Spot, forward, and par rates
IR swaps are seen as a benchmark of market interest rates.
1 MM 1.5 year-loan, six months forward means a load made in six months for 1.5 years. This load might pay 1.037 MM in two years.But investors and traders oftern prefer to quote and think in terms of IR, which is more intuitive than prices and is expressed as annual rates.
We will study how to convert the IR with quoted given pries and cash flows.
simple interest and compounding (meaning comes directly from the name)
## Extracting discount factors from IRS
One thing needs to be paied attention to is that fixed-recevier pays notional at settlement and then receives fixed payment and a fictional payment of notional at maturity, which is important for interpreting the IRS. From this interpretation, we can derive the discount factor.
## Spot rates, forward rates
spot rates can be obtained from IRS while using the interpretation of IRS
forward rates can be obtained from spot rates
forward reates f(t) means the rate from t-.5 to t
## Par rates
In the circumstance of IRS, it's the swap rates.
annuity factor A(T) = \sum_{t=1}^{2T}d(t/2)

## Trading case study
Forward Swap rates as of May 28,2010, the curve of EUR is abnormal in the sense that "102-30s" forward curve slops so steeply downward. The macroeconomic context was concerned about the fiscal difficulties and economic prospects of EUR countries triggered by fears that Greece and a number of other countries might default on their government debts.
Technical context was the need for European pension funds and insurance companies to invest in long-dated assets, (or in swap language, to receive fixed on the long end in order to make their asset profiles better match their long-term liabilities). After Solvency II directive, this needs were acute. Demand for fix-recevied long-end becomes more than the supply which drives down long-term swap rates.

Market practitioners use the word **flattening** (respectively steepening) to describe shifts in which either 1) longer-term rates fall by more than shorter-term rates, or 2) shorter-term rates rise by more than longer-term rates.
To understand how to construct a Portfolio to bet on flatterning.
