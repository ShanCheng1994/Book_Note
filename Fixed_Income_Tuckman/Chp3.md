This chapter, we will talk about Returns, spreads and yields.
Yields is a practical and intuitive way to quote price and is used extensively for quick insight and analysis.
# Definitions
## Realized Returns
net returns = gross returns minus financing costs. Computing a realized return over a longer holding period requires keeping track of the rate at which coupons are reinvested over the holding period.
When calculating realized returns on securities, even when those securities are financed, it is conventional to divide that final value by the initial price of the security.
## Spreads
P = P(R)+epsilon, R is the term structure of rates, spreads is defined as P = P(R+s) without using epsilon.
## Yield-to-Maturity
This rate is the only one which discount a security's cash flows given that security's market price.
For a coupon bond, when c=y, price = par value, when c>y, P>1, when c<y, P<1.

## Yield Curves and the Coupon Effect
The phrase "Yield curve" is used often, but its meaning is not very precise because the concept of yield is intertwined with the cash flows of a particular bond. Yield to maturity can only be used to price that security.
he fact that fairly priced bonds of the same maturity but different coupons have different yields-to-maturity is called the coupon effect.The implication of this effect is that yield is not a reliable measure of relative value.  Just because one fixed income security has a higher yield than another does not necessarily mean that it is a better investment.

## Components of P&L and Returns
Decomposition is extremely useful for understanding how money is being made or lost in a trading book.
P&L = price appreciation + cash-carry, which consists of explicit cash flows like coupon payments and financing costs
Total price appreciation = carry-roll-down (passage of time)+ Rate changes + spread change
- carry-roll-down: the change as expected (no change in term structure and spread) while supposing unchanging of spreadã€‚ P&L due to roll-down is meant to convey how much a position earns due to the fact that, as a security matures, its cash flows are priced at earlier points on the term structure. the P&L due to the passage of time excluding cash carry, is called carry-roll-down
About Carry-Roll-Down scenarios, one common choice is to assume that forward rates equal expectations of future rates and that, as time passes, these forward rates are realized. A second common choice assumes that the entire term structure of interest rates remains unchanged over time. Another carry-roll-down assumption is that a bond's yield remains un-changed, which is not so much useful.
